# This file will be loaded from classpath.
# These properties will be set into JVM system properties.
# Spring will use these properties to further load other configuration files.

# The path in the classpath for this file are hard-coded in the caller Java class!
# So, the file must be located at the same path in the classpath.

# The path to the main application context xml file.
# The file can be inside jar (if fixed) or outside jar (if configurable).

# It is possible only define several of the following properties, if no need all.

# Internal path normally refer to path for those configuration files inside jar.
# Normally, the files should not be changed. But in rare cases, they can be overrided by redirecting internal path.
# "local_internal" means the path used by one of the components inside jar.
# "shared_internal" means the path used by all of the components inside jar.
# But normally, there is only one component in one jar. So, it is suitable to set same path for both.

file_path.context.shared_internal=classpath:/spring_config/shared/

# External path refer to path for those configuration files outside jar.
# Normally, the files may be changed case by case.
# "local_external" means the path used by one of the components inside jar.
# "shared_internal" means the path used by all of the components inside jar, or maybe all of the components inside many jars.
# Normally, each jar has only one component. And for each component, there is a separated "local_external".

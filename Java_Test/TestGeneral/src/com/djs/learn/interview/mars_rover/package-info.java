/**
 * From SCB.
 * Mars Rover.
 * <p>
 * Requirement:<br>
 * Develop an API that moves a rover around on a grid.
 * <p>
 * Rules:<br>
 * You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.
 * The rover receives a character array of commands.
 * Implement commands that move the rover forward/backward (F,B).
 * Implement commands that turn the rover left/right (L,R).
 * Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another. (planets are spheres after all)
 * <p>
 * Optional (Time permitting):<br>
 * Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new square. If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last
 * possible point and reports the obstacle.

Integrate Oracle SQL developer with SQL Plus from XE
2011.09.20

* Install Oracle XE and Oracle SQL developer.

* Suppose you want to use SQL*Plus from XE to connect other DB;
  other DB connection string is "192.168.0.1:1521:mytest";
  you want connection id as "testdb".

* Edit "tnsnames.ora" in "<OracleXE_folder>\app\oracle\product\10.2.0\server\NETWORK\ADMIN\".
  Add section:

  testdb =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 192.168.0.1)(PORT = 1521))
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = mytest)
    )
  )

* Run SQL*Plus from command line:

  > sqlplus "your_username/your_password@testdb"

  It should work.

* Open Oracle SQL developer, from "Tools / External Tools", add new entry, and fill at least following properties:
  Program Executable: cmd
  Arguments: /c start sqlplus.exe "your_username/your_password@testdb"
  (Notes: you can specify "your_username@testdb", then need to enter password; or "/@testdb", then need to enter both user name and password.)
  Run Directory: <OracleXE_folder>\app\oracle\product\10.2.0\server\BIN
  Log Output to Messages Log: uncheck box

* In Oracle SQL developer, run SQL*Plus from tool menu or toolbar.

Install Apache HTTP server, Tomcat, PHP, MySQL on Windows (Esp. Windows 7)
2011.05.04 - 2012.06.08 (Obsolete)


I don't want to show you each details with pictures, you can find them by Google. I just want to point out some you-may-miss steps, especially the integration parts.


* Installation packages

  Try to download installation files with "*.msi" or "*.exe" formats, not "*.zip" or "*.gz" ones. Because installation copies can do some configurations and integration automatically. Download them from "www.apache.org", "http://windows.php.net/download/" and "www.mysql.com".

  The installation files I am using:
    httpd-2.4.2-win32-ssl_0.9.8.zip
    apache-tomcat-6.0.35.exe
    php-5.4.3-Win32-VC9-x86.zip
    php5apache2_4.dll-php-5.4-win32.zip
    mysql-5.5.25-win32.msi
    Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Runtimes (Download from Microsoft)

  The useful tools for MySQL:
    mysql-workbench-gpl-5.2.40-win32.msi

  The files for integration:
    tomcat-connectors-1.2.37-windows-i386-httpd-2.4.x.zip (Download from Apache Tomcat)
    mysql-connector-java-5.1.20.zip (Download from MySQL Connect/J)

   Note that Tomcat requires JRE 5 or 6, while MySQL Workbench requires .NET Framework 4 runtimes.


* Installation orders

  Install them in following order:

    Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Runtimes
    Apache HTTP server (Default: "C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache2.4")
    Apache Tomcat (Default: "C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 6.0")
    PHP (Default: "C:\Program Files\PHP")
    MySQL (Default: "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.5")
    MySQL Workbench

  Because Tomcat installation will update "<Apache2.4>\conf\httpd.conf"; and PHP installation will update "<Apache2.4>\conf\httpd.conf" and "<Apache2.4>\conf\mime.types" files of HTTP server.

  After installation, do not run them. If any one has been started automatically, stop it first. 


* Tips for setting up Apache HTTP server

  Modify following lines in "<Apache2.4>\conf\httpd.conf", change all of "c:/Apache24" to C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.4".

  Modify following lines in "<Apache2.4>\conf\httpd.conf", change to your website location:
    DocumentRoot "C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.4/htdocs"
    <Directory "C:/Program Files/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.4/htdocs">

  Unzip "tomcat-connectors-1.2.37-windows-i386-httpd-2.4.x.zip", copy "mod_jk.so" into "<Apache2.4>\modules".


* Tips for setting up Apache Tomcat

  Modify following lines in "<Tomcat 6.0>\conf\server.xml", change to your web services location:
    <Host name="localhost"  appBase="webapps"
  If changed to different location, please copy at least those subfolders "host-manager", "manager" and "ROOT" inside "<Tomcat 6.0>\webapps" to the new location. And this location can be same or different from the HTTP website location.

  To integrate with Apache HTTP server, generate "<Tomcat 6.0>\conf\workers.properties" file. You can find sample from Tomcat website. The worker's name should be "ajp13", because Tomcat has inserted relative settings into "<Apache2.4>\conf\httpd.conf".

  If "<WebServices>" location is the same as "<Website>" location, check "<Apache2.4>\conf\httpd.conf", and add or modify following lines:

    # Tomcat connector.
    LoadModule jk_module modules/mod_jk.so
    JkWorkersFile "<Tomcat 6.0>\conf\workers.properties"
    JkLogFile "<Apache2.4>\logs\mod_jk.log"
    # All requests go to ajp13 by default.
    JkMount /* ajp13
    # Serve html, jpg and gif using httpd.
    JkUnMount /*.html ajp13
    JkUnMount /*.htm ajp13
    JkUnMount /*.php ajp13
    JkUnMount /*.jpg ajp13
    JkUnMount /*.gif ajp13

  If "<WebServices>" location is different from "<Website>" location, check "<Apache2.4>\conf\httpd.conf", and add or modify following lines:

    # Tomcat connector.
    LoadModule jk_module modules/mod_jk.so
    JkWorkersFile "<Tomcat 6.0>\conf\workers.properties"
    JkLogFile "<Apache2.4>\logs\mod_jk.log"
    # JkAutoAlias when WebServices location is different from Website location.
    JkAutoAlias "D:\WorkCompany\MyWebServices"
    # All requests go to ajp13 by default.
    JkAutoAlias "<WebServices>"
    JkMount /* ajp13
    # Serve html, jpg and gif using httpd.
    JkUnMount /*.html ajp13
    JkUnMount /*.htm ajp13
    JkUnMount /*.php ajp13
    JkUnMount /*.jpg ajp13
    JkUnMount /*.gif ajp13

  Copy global and common jar libs into "<Tomcat 6.0>\lib", if any. Such as:
    commons-logging-1.1.1.jar (for logging)
    jstl.jar (for JSTL)
    log4j-1.2.16.jar (for logging)
    log4j.properties (self-defined for logging system info)
    mysql-connector-java-5.1.16-bin.jar (for MySQL)
    standard.jar (for JSTL)


* Tips for setting up PHP

  Unzip "php-5.4.3-Win32-VC9-x86.zip" to a folder, such as "C:\Program Files\PHP".
  Copy "php.ini-development" to "php.ini".

  Unzip "php5apache2_4.dll-php-5.4-win32.zip" (php5apache2_4.dll) to "<PHP>".

  check "<PHP>\php.ini", add following lines:
    extension_dir="C:\Program Files\PHP\ext"

  check "<Apache2.4>\conf\httpd.conf", add lines
    PHPIniDir "C:\Program Files\PHP\"
    LoadModule php5_module "C:\Program Files\PHP\php5apache2_4.dll"

  check "<Apache2.4>\conf\mime.types", add lines
    application/x-httpd-php	php
    application/x-httpd-php-source	phps


* Running

  Now, you can run them.

  If Apache HTTP server or Apache Tomcat server cannot start, most probably that is due to another running process using the same listening port (default 80 for HTTP server, 8080 for Tomcat). Use tools (suc has TCPView from "www.sysinternals.com") to find it out.


* Installation on Windows 7

  Pls refer to another tip doc.

Setup PHP, Xdebug and Eclipse PDT on Windows 7 x64
2011.05.11 - 2011.10.30 (Obsolete)


* Installation packages

  Download packages from "www.php.net", "www.xdebug.org" and "www.eclipse.org":
    php-5.2.17-Win32-VC6-x86.msi (Thread-Safe version)
    php_xdebug-2.1.2-5.2-vc6.dll (Thread-Safe version)
    eclipse-jee-helios-SR1-win32.zip

    (Why PHP 5.2? From "http://windows.php.net/download/": If you are using PHP with Apache 1 or Apache2 from apache.org you need to use the VC6 versions of PHP. In order to use 5.3, you need to isntall VC9 compiled httpd from "http://www.apachelounge.com/download/". So, also download VC6 version of Xdebug.)

    (If you prefer Non-Thread-Safe version, download copies with "nts" in file name).


* Tips for setting up PHP

  After intalling PHP, and make sure it is running ok before installing Xdebug.
  Open Command Prompt, and go to "<PHP>\", run
    >php -m
  There is "[Zend Modules]" with no item now.


* Tips for setting up Xdebug

  Copy "php_xdebug-2.1.1-5.2-vc6.dll" to "<PHP>\ext".

  Check "<PHP>\php.ini", add following lines:
    [Xdebug]
    zend_extension_ts="C:\Program Files (x86)\PHP\ext\php_xdebug-2.1.2-5.2-vc6.dll"
    xdebug.remote_enable=true
    xdebug.remote_host=127.0.0.1

  Open Command Prompt, and go to "<PHP>\", run
    >php -m
  There is
    [PHP]
    ...
    Xdebug
    ...
    [Zend Modules]
    Xdebug


* Tips for setting up Eclipse

  You can download the package of "Eclipse for PHP Developers", but I installed the package of "Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers", then installed PDT plugin from "Install New Software..." from "http://download.eclipse.org/releases/helios/".

  Then refer to document "http://www.eclipse.org/pdt/articles/debugger/os-php-eclipse-pdt-debug-pdf.pdf" for how to setup PHP and debuggers.


* Tip for running Eclipse PHP debug

  If the Eclipse project is a subfolder of WebSite, when first time running, open toolbar "Run/Debug Configurations.../PHP Web Page", uncheck "URL/Auto Generate", and manually input full relative path.

  For example, the project path is "<WebSite>/Web_Test/PhpSample1", the page file is "test.php".
  If check the "URL/Auto Generate", the generated path is "http://localhost" + "/PhpSample1/test.php". So, uncheck option, and manually change "/PhpSample1/test.php" to "/Web_Test/PhpSample1/test.php".

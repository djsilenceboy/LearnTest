======================================================================
Symmetric key encryption

A single key is used for both encryption and decryption.
------------------------------------------------------------
Substitution ciphers
----------------------------------------
One-time pads (OTPs)
----------------------------------------
Data Encryption Standard (DES)

56-bit key = 7 bits of 8 bytes (The 8th bit is used for parity)
----------------------------------------
Unix password encryption

A variant of DES.
----------------------------------------
Advance Encryption Standard (AES): Rijndael

AES is a block cipher using keys and blocks of 128, 192, 256 bits.
AES-256 is generally used.
======================================================================
Public key encryption
------------------------------------------------------------
Diffie-Hellman key exchange

For key distribution.
----------------------------------------
Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)

For encryption and decryption.
2048 bits or larger is better.
----------------------------------------
Elgamal

A variant of Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
Enhanced to allow encryption and authentication.
----------------------------------------
Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)

Based on Elgamal.
Only allow authentication, not provide confidentiality.
----------------------------------------
Elliptic Curve Encryption (ECC)

For encryption.
Used over RSA or Diffie-Hellman.
======================================================================
Digital signatures

A form of encryption to provide for authentication of signed information.
------------------------------------------------------------
Secure hash functions

To create checksum of at least 256 bits.
Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) is mostly used: SHA-256, SHA-512.

MD5 and SHA-1 have deprecated.
======================================================================
Key certificates

Central Authority (CA)
------------------------------------------------------------
User generates a key pair.
User signs user's public key and user information with user's private key.
User sends signed request to CA.
CA verifies user request.
CA signs user request with CA's private key, and generates certificate.
CA sends certificate to user.
User verifies certificate with CA's public key.

Note that:
CA's public key is public available.
User's CA signed certificate may be public available.
======================================================================
Trust in encryption systems
------------------------------------------------------------
Hierarchy

Hierarchical trust model: Trust in the keys is derived from a higher authority.
Root CA certificate, CA certificate path.
